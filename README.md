# COLLECTION DASH
This is a planned web application where anyone can play a timer-based game. 
The goal is to collect as many as possible packages appearing in the field.
After the end of 60 seconds, the score will be stored in a database.
*The accumulated score of all games has a corresponding monetary amount
 which will be donated to Red Cross.*
